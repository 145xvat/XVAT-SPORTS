  <div id="manutd">Ghana legend Asamoah Gyan ends the GOAT debate:

“I laugh when people compare Messi to Ronaldo. I laugh because Ronaldo is a centre forward. Ronaldo started his career as a right winger, but he is primarily a centre forward. This is a position players like me and George Weah played. But Messi is a playmaker. You can compare him to players like Abedi Pele, Maradona and Ronaldinho.
You can compare Messi and Ronaldo in terms of the number of Ballon d’Ors won. But you cannot compare the two in terms of quality. 
I feel Messi is gifted. You need Messi in your team more than Ronaldo. But I respect Ronaldo because of his hard work. He really worked hard to get to his current position.
Ronaldo cannot play if if doesn’t train for two days. But Messi is gifted so he can play even if he doesn’t train for two weeks. All he has to do is a little shake-up. So that’s a key difference between the two. 
I think Messi will be better in my team because he can easily dribble five players [and give the team an advantage].”

  <div id="manutd">Rafael Van der Vaart: “€100M for Declan Rice. What does he do? He comes to collect a ball only to pass it back to John Stones. He is useless. If you are truly worth €100M, then you should be able to play a ball forward”.

“This was too rude”. Declan deserves more respect. What do you think? ⤵️

  <div id="manutd">🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 Kobbie Mainoo on the Euro 2024 final: “It's been good to play my part when called upon. We’ve come so far but this is the biggest hurdle yet. To represent my country and to be in the final of the Euros is crazy. I can’t look back on it too fondly until the job is finished and we have lifted the trophy.”

Mentality monster! 🔴👊🏼

    🚨 Ten Hag Will Be Fully In-charge Of Manchester United This Season!

We commend Jadon Sancho for appologizing. Nobody is above mistake. The ability to say, "I am Sorry" doesn't make one half  man but earns you respect.

Ten Hag should note that the work of a Manager entails managing his player's Psychomotor. Once the team is in a good mental state of mind, successful it becomes.

Manchester United is now a balanced team just like a balanced diet. When you eat a balanced diet then pathogen has no business with your body because balanced diet produces T-Cells that will fight pathogens. The same with Manchester United, their attack are capable of dealing with Man City, Arsenal, Tottenham, Liverpool and Chelsea. Arsenal that is trusting the process knows there is danger now. In fact, we cannot wait for the season to start to tear teams apart.

We pray for our players  to blend together and achieve success. Just like a father  manages his family, Ten Hag should do the same because we are now one big family of Manchester United .

Wait till the Season starts and you will understand why United is called the "Red Devil."😈 We are now United for life!! 💪♥️❤️❤️

Ahead we move ✔️
